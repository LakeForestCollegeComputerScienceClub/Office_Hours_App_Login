# Office_Hours_App_Login
As a part of the final project for Web Development, our professor assigned each student a different part of an application to build. The files present in this repository was my contribution. The full product cannot be posted as other students were unable to complete their parts before the semester ended. My role was to create the login protocols for the faculty to login to. It uses a cookie with a random 32 character string and database holding all cookies added to verify logged in users and to log out users.
